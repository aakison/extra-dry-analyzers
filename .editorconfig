# CA1303: Specify Localized Text
# Localized text strings are good for localization, but easy to refactor if/when this product is globalized.  
# Superior readability of text during pre-globalization phases is preferred.

# CA1307: Specify StringComparison
# Providing culture for `string.Contains()` is typically not applicable since queries go to database.  
# Culture more likely to break EF than fix localization issues. Cross this localization bridge if and when it is necessary.

# CA1720: Identifier contains type name
# This occurs when the system sees the type 'Guid' named 'Guid' which have the same name.
# Interesting debate but letting this one go as these are effectively homonyms.

# GUID - The property, whose purpose is a globally unique Id with other names, but most commonly in conversation as "What's its Guid?"
